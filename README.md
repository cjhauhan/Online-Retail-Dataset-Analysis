Online Retail Data Analysis
This repository contains a comprehensive data analysis project conducted on the Online Retail Dataset, which was sourced from Kaggle. The dataset consists of over 500,000 transactions made by customers of a UK-based online retailer between December 2010 and December 2011. The primary objective of this project was to explore, clean, and analyze the dataset to extract actionable insights that could be valuable for improving business strategies and customer engagement.

Project Highlights:
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
The raw dataset contained numerous missing values and duplicate entries, making it necessary to perform a thorough data cleaning process. Key cleaning steps involved handling null values, removing duplicates, and ensuring consistent data formats (e.g., proper date/time parsing and data type conversions).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
EDA was used to understand the underlying patterns in the data. Visualizations such as bar plots, line graphs, and heatmaps were generated using Python libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn. These visualizations highlighted key trends in customer purchasing behavior, seasonal sales patterns, and the most popular products.

Customer Segmentation and Clustering:
One of the critical aspects of the analysis was customer segmentation. By applying K-means clustering, customers were grouped based on their purchasing behaviors. This segmentation can help businesses tailor marketing strategies, focusing on high-value customers or customers likely to churn.

Sales Performance Analysis:
The project included a detailed analysis of the retailerâ€™s sales performance across different countries and time periods. Key performance metrics like average order value, total revenue per country, and the monthly growth rate were calculated and visualized.

RFM Analysis:
Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) analysis was conducted to classify customers based on their transaction history. This method allowed the identification of the most valuable customers and helped inform strategies for customer retention and targeted marketing.
